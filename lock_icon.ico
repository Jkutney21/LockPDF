This is a placeholder for an ICO file. Since I cannot create binary files directly, 
you would need to either:
1. Download a lock icon (.ico file) from an icon website
2. Convert a lock image to ICO format using an online converter
3. Use the Windows built-in icons

For now, the script will use the text-based approach with the lock emoji in the title.
